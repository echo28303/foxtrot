## Introduction

The blockchain industry has witnessed significant growth and diversification over the past decade, yet it faces persistent challenges in achieving sustainable consensus mechanisms. Traditional PoW blockchains often suffer from energy inefficiency and an uneven distribution of rewards among early participants, while PoS networks can struggle with initial distribution and decentralization. Foxtrot Blockchain introduces a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both PoW and PoS to create a more equitab...

## Blockchain Overview

### Transition from PoW to PoS with Schnorr Signatures, Blake3 Hashing, and zk-STARKs for Confidentiality

#### Proof of Work (PoW) Phase

In the initial phase of our blockchain, the network employs a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Miners compete to solve computational puzzles, and the first to solve the puzzle appends a new block to the chain. This process is underpinned by Schnorr signatures for cryptographic security and Blake3 for efficient hashing. A unique feature of our approach is that miners earn a block reward equal to the network's difficulty level, ensuring a direct correlation between work performed and reward earned....

#### Proof of Stake (PoS) Phase

Once the blockchain reaches the transition block, it switches to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In this phase, validators are chosen based on their stake in the network. The selection process is secure and efficient, utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (zk-STARKs) to ensure confidentiality and integrity of transactions without revealing sensitive information. After the transition block, validators no longer receive block rewards but earn transaction fees, ensuring continued incentivization without...

## Security and Efficiency

- **Schnorr Signatures:** Our use of Schnorr signatures offers provable security and efficiency, enabling fast and secure cryptographic operations.
  
- **Blake3 Hashing:** Blake3 provides a highly efficient and secure hashing algorithm, ensuring fast processing times and strong cryptographic guarantees.
  
- **zk-STARKs:** Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge (zk-STARKs) are integrated to provide scalable and efficient zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring transaction confidentiality and enhancing overall security.

## Proof of Stake Highlights

Based on the paper "A Scalable Proof-of-Stake Blockchain in the Open Setting," our PoS implementation introduces several novel security properties:

- **Chain Soundness:** A new security property ensuring new players can join the protocol securely and that their local chain is consistent with existing honest players' chains.
  
- **Greedy Strategies:** Analyzes how players might extend multiple positions in the blockchain to gain an advantage and provides bounds on this behavior.
  
- **Adaptive Security:** Achieves adaptive security without assuming secure erasure, enhancing practical deployment in real-world settings.

### Key Properties

- **Common Prefix:** Ensures that the blockchain maintained by honest players shares a common prefix, providing consistency across the network.
  
- **Chain Quality:** Guarantees a minimum proportion of blocks in the chain are contributed by honest players, ensuring the integrity of the blockchain.
  
- **Chain Growth:** Ensures the blockchain grows at a reasonable rate, maintaining network efficiency and responsiveness.

## Detailed Construction

### Basic Core-Chain Protocol (Πcore)

- Mimics Nakamoto’s PoW design using PoS.
  
- Each PoS-player (stakeholder) attempts to extend the longest chain by solving a hash inequality involving the latest block, current round, and their signature.
  
- The new block-core is defined as Bi+1 := 〈hi, round, pk, σ〉.

### Security Against Greedy Adversaries (Πcore?)

- Defines "g-greedy" strategies where players attempt to extend multiple chains.
  
- Demonstrates that the fully greedy strategy can only improve a player's chances by a factor of e (Euler’s number).
  
- Provides security guarantees if honest players hold more than 57% of the stakes.

### Adaptive Adversaries (Πcore•)

- Addresses adversaries who can adapt their stake registrations based on the protocol state.
  
- Introduces a policy requiring stakes to be registered earlier to prevent rejection re-sampling.

### Full-Fledged Blockchain (Πmain)

- Extends the core-chain protocol to include transaction payloads.
  
- Uses the core-chain as a randomness beacon to select PoS-players for generating new blocks.

## Security Analysis

- **Chain Growth:** Honest players' chains grow at a predictable rate even under network delays.
  
- **Chain Quality:** Honest blocks dominate the chain, ensuring a high-quality blockchain.
  
- **Common Prefix:** Ensures consistency among honest players’ chains except for the last few blocks.
  
- **Chain Soundness:** New players can securely join the protocol and obtain a consistent view of the blockchain.

## Practical Implications

The proposed PoS protocol is energy-efficient and does not require the massive computational resources of PoW systems. The design is robust against common attacks, including those specific to PoS, such as nothing-at-stake and selfish mining. Suitable for large-scale deployment in open network environments, supporting scalability and security.

## Enhancements Based on "Best-Possible Unpredictable Proof-of-Stake"

The paper "Best-Possible Unpredictable Proof-of-Stake" investigates the unpredictability of PoS protocols, highlighting an impossibility result for single-extension PoS protocols and proposing a new multi-extension design framework to achieve the best possible unpredictability.

### Key Contributions

- **Impossibility Result for Single-Extension PoS:** Demonstrates that single-extension PoS protocols cannot achieve both best possible unpredictability and the common prefix property unless more than 73% of the stake is honest .

- **Multi-Extension PoS Design:** Proposes a multi-extension framework allowing players to extend multiple chains in a round, enabling the achievement of best possible unpredictability and improved security .

- **D-Distance-Greedy Strategy:** Introduces a strategy where honest players extend a set of best chains close to the longest chain, which helps in maintaining security and unpredictability .

- **New Tiebreak Rule:** Ensures the fastest chain extension among multiple chains of the same length, preventing adversaries from slowing down chain growth .

- **Security Analysis Framework:** Develops a new Markov chain-based analysis to study chain growth and common prefix properties in multi-extension protocols .

## Implementation Improvements

To enhance the design from "A Scalable Proof-of-Stake Blockchain in the Open Setting," the following improvements can be incorporated based on the findings from "Best-Possible Unpredictable Proof-of-Stake":

- **Adopt Multi-Extension Framework:** Implement the multi-extension protocol allowing honest players to extend multiple chains, increasing security against predictability-based attacks and reducing the need for a high percentage of honest stakes.

- **Implement D-Distance-Greedy Strategy:** Use the D-distance-greedy strategy to ensure that honest players extend chains close to the best chain, maintaining the common prefix and improving chain quality and growth.

- **Use New Tiebreak Rule:** Incorporate the tiebreak rule to select the fastest extendable chain among multiple chains of the same length, ensuring efficient chain growth and reducing adversarial influence.

- **Security Analysis with Markov Chains:** Apply the new Markov chain-based analysis framework to assess and ensure chain growth and common prefix properties, providing a robust security analysis for the protocol.

## Using Schnorr Signatures for Private and Public Keys in Blockchain

Schnorr signatures are a popular cryptographic scheme used in blockchain systems for creating digital signatures. The process of creating a private and public key pair using Schnorr signatures involves several steps:

### Generating the Private Key

The private key is a randomly generated number. This key must be kept secret as it is used to sign transactions and prove ownership of an account.

1. Choose a large prime number \( p \).
2. Choose a prime order \( q \) such that \( q \) divides \( p-1 \).
3. Select a generator \( g \) of the multiplicative group of integers modulo \( p \).

### Generating the Public Key

The public key is derived from the private key using the generator and prime parameters.

1. Randomly choose a private key \( x \) where \( x \in \{1, 2, \ldots, q-1\} \).
2. Compute the public key \( y \) as \( y = g^x \mod p \).

The public key \( y \) can be shared openly and is used by others to verify the digital signatures created with the corresponding private key.

### Signing a Message

To sign a message using the private key, the following steps are performed:

1. Choose a random nonce \( k \) where \( k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, q-1\} \).
2. Compute the commitment \( r \) as \( r = g^k \mod p \).
3. Compute the challenge \( e \) as \( e = H(m \,||\, r) \), where \( H \) is a cryptographic hash function and \( m \) is the message.
4. Compute the response \( s \) as \( s = k + xe \mod q \).

The signature on the message \( m \) is the pair \( (r, s) \).

### Verifying a Signature

To verify the authenticity of the signature \( (r, s) \) on a message \( m \), the verifier performs the following steps:

1. Compute the challenge \( e \) as \( e = H(m \,||\, r) \).
2. Compute \( v \) as \( v = g^s \cdot y^{-e} \mod p \).

If \( v = r \), the signature is valid.

## Implementation in Blockchain

In a blockchain, each account can be represented by a public key derived from a Schnorr signature scheme. The corresponding private key is used to sign transactions, ensuring that only the owner of the private key can authorize transactions from that account.

### Key Points

- **Private Key:** Randomly generated and kept secret. Used for signing transactions.
  
- **Public Key:** Derived from the private key and shared publicly. Used for verifying signatures.
  
- **Digital Signatures:** Ensures authenticity and integrity of transactions.

### Advantages of Schnorr Signatures

- **Efficiency:** Schnorr signatures are computationally efficient and produce shorter signatures compared to other schemes like ECDSA.
  
- **Security:** Proven secure under the discrete logarithm problem.
  
- **Simplicity:** Simpler to implement and analyze mathematically.

By incorporating Schnorr signatures, blockchain systems can achieve secure and efficient cryptographic operations, which are fundamental for transaction validation and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain ledger.

## Scientific Proofs

The security of Schnorr signatures is based on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem. The Schnorr signature scheme has been proven to be secure against adaptive chosen message attacks under the random oracle model, assuming the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.

### Key Security Properties

- **Unforgeability:** An adversary cannot produce a valid signature for a message without knowledge of the private key.
  
- **Non-repudiation:** The signature uniquely identifies the signer and cannot be denied.
  
- **Integrity:** The signature ensures that the message has not been altered.

The Foxtrot Blockchain leverages these cryptographic guarantees to provide a secure and efficient platform for decentralized transactions.
